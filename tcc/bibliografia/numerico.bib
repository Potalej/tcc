  abstract  = "A new edition of this classic work, comprehensively revised to
               present exciting new developments in this important subject The
               study of numerical methods for solving ordinary differential
               equations is constantly developing and regenerating, and this
               third edition of a popular classic volume, written by one of the
               world's leading experts in the field, presents an account of the
               subject which reflects both its historical and well-established
               place in computational science and its vital role as a
               cornerstone of modern applied mathematics. In addition to
               serving as a broad and comprehensive study of numerical methods
               for initial value problems, this book contains a special
               emphasis on Runge-Kutta methods by the mathematician who
               transformed the subject into its modern form dating from his
               classic 1963 and 1972 papers. A second feature is general linear
               methods which have now matured and grown from being a framework
               for a unified theory of a wide range of diverse numerical
               schemes to a source of new and practical algorithms in their own
               right. As the founder of general linear method research, John
               Butcher has been a leading contributor to its development; his
               special role is reflected in the text. The book is written in
               the lucid style characteristic of the author, and combines
               enlightening explanations with rigorous and precise analysis. In
               addition to these anticipated features, the book breaks new
               ground by including the latest results on the highly efficient
               G-symplectic methods which compete strongly with the well-known
               symplectic Runge-Kutta methods for long-term integration of
               conservative mechanical systems. This third edition of Numerical
               Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations will serve as a key
               text for senior undergraduate and graduate courses in numerical
               analysis, and is an essential resource for research workers in
               applied mathematics, physics and engineering.",
